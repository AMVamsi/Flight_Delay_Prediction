# Flight Delay Prediction

## Objective
The main objective of the project is to predict the arrival delay of the flights using a two-stage model. If a flight is classified a delayed, then it is piplined with the regressor to predict the delay. To predict the flight delay real world weather data is used, as weather has a major impact on the delay.
